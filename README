# Close The Gap Academy

A Django-powered learning platform that lets administrators upload video lessons organised into purchasable modules with quizzes at the end of each module. Learners can create accounts, buy access to modules, watch lessons, and take the module assessments.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Create a superuser to access the admin dashboard (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

The site will be available at http://localhost:8000.

## Running tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Key features

- Admin interface for managing modules, lessons (with video uploads), and quizzes.
